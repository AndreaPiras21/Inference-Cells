# Inference-Cells
This project containts some of the scripts used in the project entitled: "Inference of lineage hierarchies, growth and drug response mechanisms in cell 1 populations without tracking".
The following scripts are shown here:

EGS_script
EGS_script is a pdf file containing a script written in Mathematica that contain a version to perform Bayesian inference with our Galton-Watson model where only one phenotype is considered. Our method is Gibbs sampler algorithm that exploits the information derived from the probability generating function.
The script shows also few examples where we compare the numerical marginals found using this approach with the analytical marginals obtained with our analytical method.
