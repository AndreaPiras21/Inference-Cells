# Inference-Cells
This repository contains some of the scripts used in the project entitled: "Inference of lineage hierarchies, growth, and drug response mechanisms in cell populations without tracking."

The following scripts are included:

EGS_script
EGS_script is a PDF file containing a script written in Mathematica. It implements a version of our Bayesian inference method for a Galton-Watson model considering only a single phenotype. The method uses a Gibbs sampler algorithm that leverages information derived from the probability generating function. The script also includes several examples where we compare the numerical marginals obtained using this Bayesian approach with the analytical marginals derived from our exact analytical method.
